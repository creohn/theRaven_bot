            Shall be lifted—nevermore!
And my soul from out that shadow that lies floating on the floor
  And the lamp-light o’er him streaming throws his shadow on the floor
    And his eyes have all the seeming of a demon’s that is dreaming,
On the pallid bust of Pallas just above my chamber door
    And the Raven, never flitting, still is sitting, still is sitting
​
            Quoth the Raven “Nevermore.”
Take thy beak from out my heart, and take thy form from off my door!”
    Leave my loneliness unbroken!—quit the bust above my door!
    Leave no black plume as a token of that lie thy soul hath spoken!
“Get thee back into the tempest and the Night’s Plutonian shore!
    “Be that word our sign of parting, bird or fiend!” I shrieked, upstarting—
​​
            Quoth the Raven “Nevermore.”
Clasp a rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore.”
    It shall clasp a sainted maiden whom the angels name Lenore—
    Tell this soul with sorrow laden if, within the distant Aidenn,
By that Heaven that bends above us—by that God we both adore—
    “Prophet!” said I, “thing of evil!—prophet still, if bird or devil!
​​
            Quoth the Raven “Nevermore.”
Is there—is there balm in Gilead?—tell me—tell me, I implore!”
    On this home by Horror haunted—tell me truly, I implore—
    Desolate yet all undaunted, on this desert land enchanted—
Whether Tempter sent, or whether tempest tossed thee here ashore,
    “Prophet!” said I, “thing of evil!—prophet still, if bird or devil!—
​
            Quoth the Raven “Nevermore.”
Quaff, oh quaff this kind nepenthe and forget this lost Lenore!”
    Respite—respite and nepenthe from thy memories of Lenore
    “Wretch,” I cried, “thy God hath lent thee—by these angels he hath sent thee
Swung by Seraphim whose foot-falls tinkled on the tufted floor.
    Then, methought, the air grew denser, perfumed from an unseen censer
​
            She shall press, ah, nevermore!
But whose velvet-violet lining with the lamp-light gloating o’er,
    On the cushion’s velvet lining that the lamp-light gloated o’er,
    This and more I sat divining, with my head at ease reclining
To the fowl whose fiery eyes now burned into my bosom’s core
    This I sat engaged in guessing, but no syllable expressing
​
            Meant in croaking “Nevermore.”
What this grim, ungainly, ghastly, gaunt, and ominous bird of yore
    Fancy unto fancy, thinking what this ominous bird of yore—
    Then, upon the velvet sinking, I betook myself to linking
Straight I wheeled a cushioned seat in front of bird, and bust and door
    But the Raven still beguiling all my fancy into smiling,
​​
            Of ‘Never—nevermore’.”
Till the dirges of his Hope that melancholy burden bore
    Followed fast and followed faster till his songs one burden bore—
    Caught from some unhappy master whom unmerciful Disaster
“Doubtless,” said I, “what it utters is its only stock and store
    Startled at the stillness broken by reply so aptly spoken,
​​
            Then the bird said “Nevermore.”
On the morrow he will leave me, as my Hopes have flown before.”
    Till I scarcely more than muttered “Other friends have flown before—
    Nothing farther then he uttered—not a feather then he fluttered—
That one word, as if his soul in that one word he did outpour.
    But the Raven, sitting lonely on the placid bust, spoke only
​​
            With such name as “Nevermore.”
Bird or beast upon the sculptured bust above his chamber door,
    Ever yet was blessed with seeing bird above his chamber door—
    For we cannot help agreeing that no living human being
Though its answer little meaning—little relevancy bore
    Much I marvelled this ungainly fowl to hear discourse so plainly,
​​
            Quoth the Raven “Nevermore.”
Tell me what thy lordly name is on the Night’s Plutonian shore!”
Ghastly grim and ancient Raven wandering from the Nightly shore—
“Though thy crest be shorn and shaven, thou,” I said, “art sure no craven,
By the grave and stern decorum of the countenance it wore,
Then this ebony bird beguiling my sad fancy into smiling,
​​
            Perched, and sat, and nothing more.
Perched upon a bust of Pallas just above my chamber door—
    But, with mien of lord or lady, perched above my chamber door—
    Not the least obeisance made he
In there stepped a stately Raven of the saintly days of yore
    Open here I flung the shutter, when, with many a flirt and flutter,
​​
            ’Tis the wind and nothing more!”
Let my heart be still a moment and this mystery explore
      Let me see, then, what thereat is, and this mystery explore—
    “Surely,” said I, “surely that is something at my window lattice
Soon again I heard a tapping somewhat louder than before.
    Back into the chamber turning, all my soul within me burning,
​​
            Merely this and nothing more.
This I whispered, and an echo murmured back the word, “Lenore!”—
    And the only word there spoken was the whispered word, “Lenore?”
    But the silence was unbroken, and the stillness gave no token,
Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortal ever dared to dream before
    Deep into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering, fearing,
​​
            Darkness there and nothing more.
That I scarce was sure I heard you”—here I opened wide the door
    And so faintly you came tapping, tapping at my chamber door,
    But the fact is I was napping, and so gently you came rapping,
“Sir,” said I, “or Madam, truly your forgiveness I implore
    Presently my soul grew stronger
​
            This it is and nothing more.”
Some late visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door
    “’Tis some visitor entreating entrance at my chamber door—
    So that now, to still the beating of my heart, I stood repeating
Thrilled me—filled me with fantastic terrors never felt before
    And the silken, sad, uncertain rustling of each purple curtain
​​
            Nameless here for evermore.
For the rare and radiant maiden whom the angels name Lenore—
    From my books surcease of sorrow—sorrow for the lost Lenore—
    Eagerly I wished the morrow
And each separate dying ember wrought its ghost upon the floor.
Ah, distinctly I remember it was in the bleak December
​​
Only this and nothing more.”
“’Tis some visitor,” I muttered, “tapping at my chamber door—
As of some one gently rapping, rapping at my chamber door.
    While I nodded, nearly napping, suddenly there came a tapping,
Over many a quaint and curious volume of forgotten lore—
Once upon a midnight dreary, while I pondered, weak and weary,
