# The Raven Bot

A bot that posts lines of Edgar Allan Poe’s famous poem.

Currently posting n times a day to [@theRaven on Mastodon](https://botsin.space/@theRaven)


## Acknowledgements

I couldn't have created this bot without the wrapper of [@edent](https://github.com/edent/Mastodon.py) – thanks a lot : )


## A few words …

This is my first Mastodon bot that triggers the API directly. I have some more bots floating through botsin.space:
- [@Diskotod](https://botsin.space/@diskotod) – posts the link every time something is published on diskotod.de
- [@Kaffee-Egoist](https://botsin.space/@Kaffee_Egoist) - posts the link to the photo every time something is published on kaffee-egoist.de
- [@KSilke_Bischoff](https://botsin.space/@Silke_Bischoff) – posts verses of the lyrics from the band Silke Bischoff
