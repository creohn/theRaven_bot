# The Raven Bot

A bot that posts lines of Edgar Allan Poe’s famous poem.
The Raven is Public domain & available at [Gutenberg Project](https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/17192).

Currently posting at absolutly irregular times (but no more than one post per hour [to please our bot-instance overloard & be allowed to post as listed] (https://mas.to/about) to [@Poe’s Raven on Mastodon](https://mas.to/@poes_raven)
Zero-width whitespace does the trick to post “empty” posts between the verses.


## Acknowledgements

I couldn't have created this bot without the wrapper of [@edent](https://github.com/edent/Mastodon.py) – thanks a lot : )


## A few words …

This is my first Mastodon bot that triggers the API directly. I have some more bots floating through Mastodon:
- [@creBotter](https://mas.to/@creBotter) – a Markov chain bot (aka. ebooks bot), that samples my posts from @creohn@chaos.social
- [@Diskotod](https://mas.to/@diskotod) – posts the link every time something is published on diskotod.de
- [@Kaffee-Egoist](https://mas.to/@Kaffee_Egoist) - posts the link to the photo every time something is published on kaffee-egoist.de
- [@KSilke_Bischoff](https://mas.to/@Silke_Bischoff) – posts verses of the lyrics from the band Silke Bischoff
